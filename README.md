CS50x Projects — Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University)
Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, Harvard University’s foundational computer science course.
The projects span systems programming, algorithms, data structures, Python scripting, databases, and web development, progressing from low-level C programs to full-stack web applications.

Together, these projects demonstrate strong fundamentals in problem solving, algorithmic thinking, memory management, and software design, as well as practical experience building real, working systems.

Technologies Used

Languages: C, Python, SQL, JavaScript

Web: Flask, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Concepts: Algorithms, Data Structures, Hash Tables, Graphs, Memory Management, File I/O

Tools: Git, Linux, SQLite

Projects
🗳️ Plurality Election System (C)

Implemented a vote-counting program that determines the winner of an election using plurality rules.

Managed candidates and votes using arrays and structs

Implemented input validation and string comparison

Introduced basic election logic and winner determination

Concepts: arrays, structs, conditionals, loops

🗳️ Runoff Voting System (C)

Built an instant-runoff (ranked-choice) voting system simulating real-world elections.

Tracked voter preferences using 2D arrays

Iteratively eliminated candidates with the fewest votes

Implemented majority detection and tie handling

Concepts: algorithms, iterative elimination, data modeling

🗳️ Tideman Election Algorithm (C)

Implemented the Tideman (Ranked Pairs) voting algorithm using graph theory.

Computed pairwise candidate preferences

Built and locked a directed graph while preventing cycles

Ensured correct winner selection via topological reasoning

Concepts: graphs, cycle detection, algorithmic correctness

🧬 DNA Profiling System (Python)

Created a forensic DNA analysis tool that identifies individuals based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).

Parsed CSV databases of DNA profiles

Analyzed DNA sequences to compute longest STR runs

Matched computed profiles against known individuals

Concepts: string processing, CSV parsing, algorithmic counting

📖 Speller — Hash Table Spell Checker (C)

Built a high-performance spell checker similar to those used in real applications.

Implemented a hash table with linked lists
