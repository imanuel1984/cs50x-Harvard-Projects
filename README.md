## CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University)

A comprehensive collection of programming projects completed as part of CS50x, Harvard University’s introduction to computer science.

📌 Overview

This repository contains all coursework projects and the final project completed for CS50x.
The work progresses from low-level programming in C to full-stack web development using Python, SQL, and JavaScript, demonstrating a broad and solid foundation in computer science.

Each project lives in its own branch, following the structure used throughout the course.

🚀 Final Project
Volunteer Transport Coordination Platform

A full-stack web application designed to coordinate transportation between patients and volunteer drivers.

Key Features

Role-based access: patients and volunteers

Transport request lifecycle: open → accepted → done / cancelled

Volunteer accept/reject workflow with rejection tracking

Automatic cancellation when no volunteers are available

Secure authentication and server-side authorization

Dynamic, SPA-like interface using JavaScript

Relational SQLite database design

Tech Stack

Python

Django

SQLite

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project demonstrates real-world system design, state management, permissions, and data modeling.

🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I developed:

Strong problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Hands-on experience with memory management in C

Practical database design and querying skills

Full-stack web development experience

Confidence building non-trivial, stateful applications

🤝 Academic Integrity

All projects were implemented by me.
AI-based tools were used only for debugging assistance and clarification, in accordance with CS50’s academic honesty policy.
