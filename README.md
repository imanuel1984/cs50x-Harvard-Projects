Overview

This repository documents the projects completed as part of CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science).
The projects span low-level systems programming in C, algorithmic problem solving, Python, SQL, and web development using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Together, these projects demonstrate progression from foundational programming concepts (memory, algorithms, data structures) to full-stack web applications with authentication, databases, and dynamic user interfaces.

Core Technologies Used

Languages: C, Python, JavaScript, SQL

Web: HTML, CSS, Flask

Databases: SQLite

Concepts: Algorithms, Data Structures, Memory Management, Hash Tables, Graphs, Authentication, Web APIs

Tools: Git, Linux, VS Code

Project List & Descriptions
🔹 Readability (C)

Analyzed text input to compute grade-level readability using the Coleman–Liau index.
Focused on string parsing, character classification, and mathematical formulas.

🔹 Inheritance (C)

Simulated genetic inheritance across generations.
Used recursion, structs, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

🔹 Volume (C)

Manipulated WAV audio files by adjusting sound amplitude.
Worked directly with binary file I/O and memory buffers.

🔹 Plurality (C)

Implemented a vote-counting system using plurality rules.
Practiced arrays, structs, string comparison, and input validation.

🔹 Runoff (C)

Built an instant-runoff (ranked-choice) voting system.
Handled vote redistribution, elimination logic, majority detection, and tie handling.

🔹 Tideman (C)

Implemented the Tideman ranked-pairs voting algorithm.
Used graphs, pairwise comparisons, cycle detection, and locked graph traversal.

🔹 Speller (C)

Created a high-performance spell checker using hash tables and linked lists.
Implemented custom hash functions and optimized dictionary lookups.
Focused on memory efficiency and proper cleanup.

🔹 DNA (Python)

Developed a forensic DNA profiling tool that matches STR patterns against a database.
Used CSV parsing, string analysis, and algorithmic counting logic to identify individuals.

🔹 Songs (SQL)

Queried a music database to answer analytical questions.
Focused on joins, aggregation, filtering, and SQL query optimization.

🔹 Movies (SQL)

Analyzed a movie dataset to extract insights using SQL.
Practiced complex joins, nested queries, and data relationships.

🔹 Fiftyville (SQL)

Solved a fictional crime by analyzing relational data.
Demonstrated investigative reasoning using SQL queries alone.

🔹 Trivia (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Built an interactive trivia website.
Implemented client-side logic, event handling, and dynamic feedback.

🔹 Homepage (HTML, CSS)

Created a personal multi-page website.
Focused on semantic HTML, responsive design, and clean CSS styling.

🔹 Birthdays (Python, Flask, SQL)

Built a Flask web application to store and display birthdays.
Implemented form handling, database insertion, and dynamic table rendering.

🔹 Finance (Python, Flask, SQL)

Developed a stock trading simulator web application.
Features included:

User authentication

Real-time stock price lookup

Buying and selling shares

Portfolio tracking

Transaction history

Demonstrated full-stack development with server-side validation and SQL persistence.

Final Project
🚑 STransport – Volunteer Transport Coordination Platform

A full-stack web application that connects patients needing transportation with volunteer drivers.

Key Features:

Role-based access (patient / volunteer)

Transport request lifecycle (open → accepted → done / cancelled)

Volunteer accept/reject logic with aggregated rejection handling

Automatic cancellation when no volunteers are available

Secure authentication and CSRF protection

Dynamic, SPA-like user interface with JavaScript

Technologies: Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This project demonstrates system design, authorization, state management, and real-world workflow modeling.
